## Description

Horiseon has provided the code for their website. However, index.html does not have semantic HTML elements. Additionally, the CSS file is redundant and is not in the correct order. The files need to be refactored but they should also be inspected to ensure they are logically structured, the images should be given alt tags, a title should be added, and the heading tags should be in numerical order.

By using semantic HTML elements, the browser and developer will clearly know the meaning of each section. By using the correct semantic HTML elements, the website should look exactly the same but with more functionality and readability.

Many of the selectors in the style.css file were consolidated and rearraged to shrink the file size and match the layout within the index.html file. 

Comments added to both index.html and style.css help to make it clear what changes were made as well as the function of the specific referenced code.

Additionally, the heading tags were not in order and didn't following the correct ascending pattern. The h2 tag in the footer was changed to h4 which made the tags in the right order.

One of the links didn't actually have a destination which was added to fix the missing link.

Each of the images was assigned a descriptive alt tag to help browers and developers identify the content of the images.

Finally, the website was given a title of, "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.," so the user and browser can identify the site.

All of these changes aided in refactoring the Horiseon site without changing the appearance but improving the overall quality of the code.
